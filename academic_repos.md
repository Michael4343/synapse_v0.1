# Table 2: API Availability Across Major Academic and Patent Platforms

The following table provides a strategic overview to guide the phased integration of additional platforms. It helps identify low-hanging fruit (open APIs) and long-term challenges (subscription-based APIs), enabling a data-driven development roadmap.

| Platform       | Official API Availability | Access Model                           | Data Type Available                                | Key Challenge/Consideration                                                                 |
