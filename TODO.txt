● # Deep Research Prompt: Paper Reproducibility & Claims Verification Analysis

  Analyze the following academic paper for reproducibility feasibility and claims verification:

  **Paper Title:** [INSERT PAPER TITLE]
  **Paper ID/DOI:** [INSERT DOI OR ARXIV ID]
  **Authors:** [INSERT AUTHORS]

  ---

  ## Part 1: Reproducibility Assessment

  ### 1.1 Overall Verdict
  - Provide a concise verdict message summarizing reproducibility feasibility (1-2 sentences)
  - Focus on the main challenge or opportunity

  ### 1.2 Feasibility Analysis
  For each category below, assess what resources/capabilities would be needed:

  **Data & Materials:**
  - Are datasets publicly available? Provide links and access requirements
  - Are biological materials/compounds/reagents commercially available?
  - Identify any proprietary or restricted materials

  **Protocols & Methods:**
  - How detailed are the methods sections?
  - Are supplementary protocols available?
  - Are there missing parameters or ambiguous procedures?
  - Are there validated alternative approaches?

  **Equipment & Infrastructure:**
  - What specialized equipment is required?
  - Typical cost range for key equipment
  - Are there core facility alternatives?

  **Expertise & Skills:**
  - What domain expertise is required?
  - Estimated skill level (undergraduate, graduate, specialist, expert)
  - Are training resources available?

  **Software & Code:**
  - Is analysis code publicly available?
  - What software/computational resources are needed?
  - Are there licensing or access barriers?

  ### 1.3 Critical Path
  Identify 3-5 major phases needed to reproduce the work:

  For each phase, provide:
  - **Phase name** and brief description
  - **Duration estimate** (realistic timeline)
  - **Cost estimate** (equipment, materials, labor if applicable)
  - **Key outputs** (what you achieve in this phase)
  - **Primary blockers** (what could go wrong)
    - Issue description
    - Mitigation strategy
    - Verification status (verified/inferred/uncertain)
  - **Dependencies** (what must be completed first)
  - **Risk level** (Low/Medium/High)

  ---

  ## Part 2: Claims Verification

  ### 2.1 Headline Finding
  - Extract the paper's most important/novel claim
  - Identify the primary source/evidence (e.g., "Figure 3A", "Table 2", "Supplementary Data")

  ### 2.2 Primary Open Question
  - What is the biggest uncertainty or gap in the evidence?
  - What is the potential impact if this gap matters?

  ### 2.3 Strong Evidence
  Identify 3-5 claims that have strong supporting evidence:

  For each:
  - **Claim statement**
  - **Source** (where in the paper/supplements)
  - **Notes** (why this evidence is reliable)
  - **Verification status** (verified/inferred/uncertain)

  ### 2.4 Gaps & Follow-ups
  Identify 3-5 areas where evidence is weak or missing:

  For each gap:
  - **Concern** (what's missing or uncertain)
  - **Impact** (why it matters)
  - **Severity** (Low/Medium/High)
  - **Resolvable with expert analysis?** (yes/no)

  ### 2.5 Assumptions
  List key assumptions made in your analysis or by the authors

  ## Research Guidelines

  **Sources to check:**
  - Paper full text and all supplementary materials
  - Author-provided code repositories (GitHub, etc.)
  - Public datasets referenced (GEO, ProteomeXchange, etc.)
  - Citations to methods papers
  - Author websites/lab pages for additional protocols
  - Vendor documentation for reagents/equipment
  - Community forums/discussions about the paper

  **Output format:**
  - Be specific with sources (don't say "the paper mentions" - say "Figure 2C shows")
  - Distinguish between what's explicitly stated vs. inferred
  - Flag areas where you lack information
  - Prioritize actionable, concrete findings over speculation
