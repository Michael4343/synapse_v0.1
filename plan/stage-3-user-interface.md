## Design System

### Component Library
- Use shadcn/ui components as base
- Custom components for search-specific UI
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrast ratios

### Color Palette
- Primary: Academic blue (#1e40af)
- Secondary: Neutral grays
- Success: Green for successful actions
- Warning: Orange for API issues
- Error: Red for failures

### Typography
- Headings: Inter or similar clean sans-serif
- Body: System font stack for performance
- Code: Fira Code for technical content

## UI/UX Specifications

### Homepage Layout
```
[Header with Logo & Navigation]
[Hero Section with Search Bar]
[Quick Filters Row]
[Recent Searches / Popular Topics]
[Footer]
```

### Results Page Layout
```
[Header]
[Search Bar with Applied Filters]
[Sidebar Filters] | [Results Grid/List]
[Pagination/Load More]
[Footer]
```

### Mobile Considerations
- Collapsible filter sidebar
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
- Optimized typography for small screens
- Swipe gestures for result navigation

## Implementation Notes

### State Management
- Use React Hook Form for filter forms
- Local state for UI interactions
- URL state for shareable searches
- Session storage for temporary data

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy load components below fold
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Virtualize large result lists
- Optimize images and icons

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Mobile performance**: Progressive enhancement, core functionality first
- **Filter complexity**: Start simple, add advanced options incrementally
- **Browser compatibility**: Test on major browsers and versions
- **Loading performance**: Implement skeleton screens and optimistic updates
