Semantic Scholar API ReferenceThis document provides a concise overview of the Semantic Scholar API, intended for developers building applications that leverage its data.1. IntroductionThe Semantic Scholar API provides programmatic access to a vast academic graph, containing information about scholarly publications, authors, citations, and more. It is organized into three main services:Academic Graph API: The core of the API, providing detailed information about papers, authors, and other entities in the academic graph.Recommendations API: Provides paper recommendations based on a given paper or a list of papers.Datasets API: Allows for the bulk download of the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Dataset.2. AuthenticationMost of the Semantic Scholar API endpoints are accessible without an API key, but they are rate-limited. To get a higher, personal rate limit, you can request a free API key.API Key: You can request an API key from the Semantic Scholar website. Add it to your requests using the `x-api-key` header.Rate Limits:- Without API key: 1000 requests per second (shared among all unauthenticated users)- With API key: 1 request per second (personal limit = 60 requests per minute)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Always include the API key in the `x-api-key` header
- Maintain minimum 1 second interval between requests
- Use conservative limits (60 req/min with key, 100 req/min without) to avoid rate limit errors3. Academic Graph APIThis is the main API for accessing detailed information about papers, authors, and other academic entities.3.1. Paper LookupYou can retrieve detailed information about a paper using its ID. The following IDs are supported:Semantic Scholar ID (S2ID)DOIArXiv IDMAG IDACL IDPMIDCorpus IDEndpoint: https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/{paper_id}Method: GETParameters:paper_id (required): The ID of the paper to look up.fields (optional): A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. If not specified, a default set of fields will be returned.Example Request:[https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/10.1093/mind/lix.236.433?fields=title,authors](https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/10.1093/mind/lix.236.433?fields=title,authors)
3.2. Paper SearchYou can search for papers using a query string.Endpoint: https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/searchMethod: GETParameters:query (required): The search query.fields (optional): A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response.offset (optional): The number of results to skip. Default is 0.limit (optional): The number of results to return. Default is 100.Example Request:[https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=language+models&fields=title,authors&limit=10](https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/paper/search?query=language+models&fields=title,authors&limit=10)
3.3. Author LookupYou can retrieve detailed information about an author using their Semantic Scholar ID.Endpoint: https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/author/{author_id}Method: GETParameters:author_id (required): The Semantic Scholar ID of the author.fields (optional): A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response.3.4. Author SearchYou can search for authors using a query string.Endpoint: https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1/author/searchMethod: GETParameters:query (required): The search query.fields (optional): A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response.offset (optional): The number of results to skip. Default is 0.limit (optional): The number of results to return. Default is 100.4. Recommendations APIThis API provides paper recommendations based on a seed paper or a list of positive and negative examples.Endpoint: https://api.semanticscholar.org/recommendations/v1/papers/Method: POSTParameters:positivePaperIds (required): A list of paper IDs to use as positive examples.negativePaperIds (optional): A list of paper IDs to use as negative examples.limit (optional): The number of recommendations to return. Default is 100.fields (optional): A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response.5. Datasets APIThis API allows you to download the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Dataset in bulk. You can download the entire dataset or get incremental updates.List Releases: Get a list of available dataset releases.List Datasets in a Release: Get a list of datasets in a specific release.Download Links: Get the download links for a specific dataset.For detailed information on how to use the Datasets API, please refer to the official documentation.6.
